Fork this repository and add your own data. 

To include your dataset into GloBI, make sure that you:

1. mention http://globalbioticinteractions.org in your README.md . 
2. include a ```.globi.yml``` file to store your dataset meta data (e.g. source citation, data format). 

Note: this is a proof of concept.
