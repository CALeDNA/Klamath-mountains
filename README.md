This repository provides an example on how to share your interaction data with Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, http://globalbioticinteractions.org) .

If you want to share your own data through GloBI:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Edit your ```README.rd``` to describe your data in a human readable form.
3. Ensure that your README.rd contains a reference to ```http://globalbioticinteractions.org```.
4. Edit your ```globi.json``` to provide a machine readable description of your dataset (e.g. citation, license, version, files, format).

After you do this, the data will be available through GloBI within a day or so.

Note: this is a proof of concept.

If you have any questions: please [open an issue](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/template-dataset/issues/new).
